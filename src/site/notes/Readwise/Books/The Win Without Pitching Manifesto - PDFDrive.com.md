## Highlights
- Our thinking is our highest value product; we will not part with it without appropriate compensation. If we demonstrate that we do not value our thinking, our clients and prospects will not. Our paying clients can rest assured that our best minds remain focused on solving their problems and not the problems of those who have yet to hire us.
    - Note: Perché è importante non risolvere nulla prima di farsi pagare? Perché così possiamo fare al meglio quello che facciamo e rassicuriamo il cliente: il cliente paga per avere un servizio che non solo gli risolva i problemi ma anche che sia di qualità top.
      E la qualità top la ottieni solo se ti concentri, metti un'alta barriera di ingresso e così ti puoi concentrare tu e tranquillizzare il cliente che non stai facendo gratis cose per altri
- there is a line that separates proving our ability to solve the client’s problem from actually solving his problem. We shall not be lured into crossing over this line before we are paid.
- It is as simple as deciding we will no longer do it, writing this commitment into a policy statement, and then stating to the client with polite conviction, “It is our policy to not begin to solve our clients’ problems before we are engaged.”
- The line that separates proving our ability to solve the client’s problem from actually solving his problem begins at the diagnosis. We correctly collect preliminary diagnostic information in the buying cycle in order to assess the client’s situation and make a determination of our ability to help. But we should not progress so far as to share our diagnosis with the client before we are hired and appropriately paid. Beyond that, we certainly should not be prescribing strategy without proper diagnosis and compensation. Free pitching is free thinking, period
- The transition from intent prospect to new client takes place through a series of steps, each an escalation in his commitment. While we do not doubt his word when he speaks it, we must remember that he is not fully committed until he has parted with his money.
- There is no need for us to be tentative about stating our requirement for a deposit before we begin working for the client. We simply say, “We’ll get started as soon as we receive the deposit, as is our policy for all new clients.”
- We will resist putting ourselves in a position where we have overinvested in the buying cycle only to find the client cannot afford to pay us what we are worth. We will set a Minimum Level of Engagement and declare it early in conversations so that if the client cannot afford us, both parties will be able to walk away before wasting valuable resources.
- Those who cannot talk about it, do not make it.
- The client has a budget, or at the very least, budget limitations, and we should have our own parameters that define our minimum client size
- As soon as the opportunity arises we will lean into the discomfort of the topic, deal with it immediately and eliminate the stress from the subject. In time we will learn to do this with ease.
- Soon after a need is initially determined, it is incumbent on us to let the prospect know that we only work with a small number of new clients every year and therefore can only add clients that will spend at or above our Minimum Level of Engagement
- We want to develop the habit of routinely sharing our Minimum Level of Engagement in every first discussion of an opportunity with a new prospect, while always reserving the right to waive it, if appropriate
    - Note: Il livello minimo di ingaggio è la barriera di ingresso, quella che va chiarita presto e all'inizio di un percorso insieme ad un cliente.
      Il suo fine non è quello strettamente economico ma è un fine strategico, con una barriera di ingresso di questo tipo riusciamo a essere selettivi sulle collaborazioni da avviare.
- . If we were to accept even half of the project work that comes to us, then we would find ourselves aimlessly building a tactical firm burdened by too many small clients and projects, with the commensurate challenges of poorer financial reward and less fulfillment. We will refuse more project work than we accept, but from time to time we will accept it. It is here that we would waive our Minimum Level of Engagement.
- When we do choose to waive our minimum and accept either project work or the occasional more meaningful strategic engagements just below our minimum, we can still benefit from its power by keeping it in place as an obstacle that we may or may not move aside.
    - Note: Quello del livello minimo di ingaggio è ovviamente una regola che per il cliente deve essere percepita come qualcosa di rigido ed inalienabile.
      Noi, in separata sede, possiamo decidere se metterla da parte oppure no.
- If we find that the client does not meet our minimum, but for other reasons, may still represent a lucrative opportunity, we can simply follow up with language such as, “Before I say no, let me ask you a few questions.” This keeps the minimum in play and lets us continue to gather information to make an assessment of the fit. In this way, we better manage the dynamics of the buying cycle.
- The answer to the question, “Can and will the client afford us?” is vital information that we must resolve to uncover as soon as possible.
- Discussing money early is an easily formed habit that, once acquired, helps us better make the decisions that shape the future of our practice.
