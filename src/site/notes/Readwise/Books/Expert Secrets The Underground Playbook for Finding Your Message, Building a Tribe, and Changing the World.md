## Highlights
- THE 4-QUESTION CLOSE (FOR HIGH-TICKET OFFERS)
- Even though this is called the 4-Question Close Script, it’s more like a 4-phase script. There are four primary questions, but you will be asking follow-up questions to dig deeper and get more complete answers.
- Before prospects get on the phone with you, they fill out an application form so you can pre-qualify them. Then you should have an assistant contact them to set up a 30-minute call.
- Hey, this is Russell and I’m excited to be on the call with you. So here’s how these calls work. I’m going to ask you four questions. Depending on how you answer them and how well we get along, we’ll decide whether to move forward. Sound fair enough?
- You’re getting a micro-commitment here, a little yes right at the start. You’re also setting the ground rules so you can steer the conversation where you want it to go. Once they agree, it’s time to start asking the questions.
- Imagine you and I were to start working together today. I teach you everything I know and do everything I can to help you get results. Now imagine we’re sitting in a coffee shop a year from now. What would have happened in your life, both personally and professionally, for you to feel happy with your progress? What would make you believe that this was the best decision you ever made?
- If they can’t answer this question, you don’t want to work with them because you’ll never be able to satisfy them. No matter how much you accomplish—and no matter how much they pay you—if they can’t articulate their desires, then you won’t be able to make them a reality
- So ask follow-up questions based on their answers.
- > > Question #1
  > > Why do you want to make $10,000 a month? Why do you want that fancy new house? What’s so important about the school district you’re in?
- Clearly, you know what you want. You’ve painted a really great picture for me. So let me ask you this—why don’t you have it yet? What’s been standing in your way or holding you back?
- You want people who will take responsibility for their own actions. So listen for some version of “I don’t know how.” Maybe they say, “I tried XYZ program, but I just didn’t understand the finer details. I need to take the time to master the process.” The key here is the word I. If they talk about themselves a lot, then chances are you can help them. If they don’t know how to do something and you can help them, you’re going to have a successful relationship.
- I want you to think about what resources, connections, talents, or skills you have access to that you’re not currently utilizing 100%, that we could use to help overcome your obstacles and achieve your goals
- Keep asking, “What else? What else?” until they run out of ideas. When they do, you say this:
- Okay, so let’s review for a minute.
  > > > 1. It looks like you know exactly what you want. You told me you want __________ because __________.
  > > > 2. Now you haven’t been able to achieve that before primarily because of __________ and __________, right?
- Now I briefly talk about my experience with the same obstacles they are struggling with, and ask them if they think I could help them to overcome those obstacles.
- How much more money do you think you’d make (or how much weight would you lose or how much better would your marriage be) if you were able to eliminate the obstacles and leverage those resources?”
- Oh man, if I could do that, I’m pretty sure I could make a million dollars (or lose a ton of weight, be so much happier in my marriage)…”
- 4. So I only have one more question. Do you want me to help you?
- Great! Here’s how it works. My fee is $__________. For that money, you get __________. I’m here to help you. I can transfer you over to my assistant to take care of the financial details right now. Would you like to do that?
- If they say yes, you’re done. Usually the only reason they won’t agree at this point is because they don’t have the money. If that’s the case, you can offer a payment plan.
- EMAIL EPIPHANY FUNNELS

- Soap Opera Sequences (SOS), which are the emails you send to someone when they first join your list. He called them soap opera sequences because each email ends with a hook that draws you to the next episode, just like a soap opera does
- So I took the Perfect Webinar and broke down the four core stories and the stack, added each into an email, and tested it out. The results were…well, they were amazing! So much so that we are now going back and adding them into every funnel we have.
- One of the keys to remember in soap opera sequence like this is that each email needs to pull people into the next story in the next email. Think about how good soap operas, reality shows and most shows on TV are able to pull you through the commercial breaks and week to week by getting you excited by what is about to happen, then cutting it off. We do the same thing in these emails, teasing about the next email that’s coming so they are anxiously waiting for it.
- Well, when I first heard Chet explain how the Dream 100 worked, I realized that there were probably 100 people who already had MY dream customers. They had the traffic. I didn’t need to create it, I just needed to figure out how to get those people to come and see my new opportunity instead.
  The first step in this Dream 100 process was going back to [Secret #1](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/71679177#filepos46003). Remember when I created my new niche? We started with the three hot markets (health, wealth, and relationships).

  From there, I drilled down into a sub-niche inside of one of those markets. Then within that sub-niche, I created my new opportunity.
  I found that the key to the Dream 100 was to step back from my niche and go back up to the submarket level. Inside of that submarket are all the niches where my traffic is already congregating. All I needed to do was figure out WHO was controlling that traffic.
